# toposoid-component-dispatcher-web
This is a WEB API that works as a microservice within the Toposoid project.
Toposoid is a knowledge base construction platform.(see [Toposoid　Root Project](https://github.com/toposoid/toposoid.git))
This microservice integrates two major microservices. 
One is a microservice that analyzes the predicate argument structure of japanese sentences, 
and the other is a microservice that makes logical inferences.
